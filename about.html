        <p class="aboutInfo">We are a team of high school programmers building a machine learning–based tool to support clinicians in assessing heart disease risk. Our goal is to reduce the burden on medical professionals by providing fast, data-driven insights that complement clinical judgment.
Designed with transparency and responsibility in mind, our platform aims to assist—not replace—doctors, helping them focus more time on patient care while enabling earlier, more informed decision-making.</p>

            <br><p>I am passionate about CardiAct because I have seen the impact of late diagnosis firsthand. I was involved in the development of this website and its foundation. I believe CardiAct has the potential to combine to power of AI and online accessible web tools in order to provide cheap assistance in areas where medical assistance is not always available.
