        <p class="aboutInfo">We are a team of high school programmers building a machine learning–based tool to support clinicians in assessing heart disease risk. Our goal is to reduce the burden on medical professionals by providing fast, data-driven insights that complement clinical judgment.
Designed with transparency and responsibility in mind, our platform aims to assist—not replace—doctors, helping them focus more time on patient care while enabling earlier, more informed decision-making.</p>

            <br><p>I enrolled in this course to explore my interest in computer science, particularly web development. Throughout the semester, I gained a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, starting with basic text formatting and progressing to image handling and full page design. 
            In the second semester, I applied more advanced techniques to build websites based on specific project requirements. This portfolio features the websites I created, each reflecting the skills and concepts I developed during the class.
